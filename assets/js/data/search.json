Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG] # TAG names should always be lowercase--- Note: The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in the Front Matter block.Timezone of dateIn order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the post’s timezone in variable date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsSimilar to TOC, the Disqus comments are loaded by default in each post, and the global switch is defined by variable comments in file _config.yml . If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MathematicsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---MermaidMermaid is a great diagrams generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:---mermaid: true---Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.ImagesPreview imageIf you want to add an image to the top of the post contents, specify the attribute src, width, height, and alt for the image:---image: src: /path/to/image/file width: 1000 # in pixels height: 400 # in pixels alt: image alternative text---Except for alt, all other options are necessary, especially the width and height, which are related to user experience and web page loading performance. Later section “Image size” will also mention this.Image captionAdd italics to the next line of an image，then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_Image sizeIn order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; }Image positionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes normal, left, and right. For example: Normal position Image will be left aligned in below sample: ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal } Float to the left ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left } Float to the right ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right } Limitation: Once the position of the image is specified, the image caption should not be added.Image shadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect, and the shadow will be visible in the light mode:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }CDN URLIf you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN URL by assigning the variable img_cdn of _config.yml file:img_cdn: https://cdn.comOnce img_cdn is assigned, the CDN URL will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with /.For instance, when using images:![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)The parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix https://cdn.com before the image path:&amp;lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png&quot; alt=&quot;The flower&quot;&amp;gt;Pinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:---pin: true---Code BlockMarkdown symbols ``` can easily create a code block as follows:This is a plaintext code snippet.Specifying LanguageUsing ```{language} you will get a code block with syntax highlight:```yamlkey: value``` Limitation: The Jekyll style highlight tag is not compatible with this theme.Line NumberBy default, all languages except plaintext, console, and terminal will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of the code block, you can append {: .nolineno} at the next line:```shellecho &#39;No more line numbers!&#39;```{: .nolineno}Specifying the FilenameYou may have noticed that the code language will be displayed on the left side of the header of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute file to achieve this:```shell# content```{: file=&quot;path/to/file&quot; }Liquid CodesIf you want to display the Liquid snippet, surround the liquid code with {% raw %} and {% endraw %}:{% raw %}```liquid{% if product.title contains &#39;Pack&#39; %} This product&#39;s title contains the word Pack.{% endif %}```{% endraw %}Or adding render_with_liquid: false (Requires Jekyll 4.0 or higher) to the post’s YAML block.Learn MoreFor more knowledge about Jekyll posts, visit the Jekyll Docs: Posts." }, { "title": "为您的 Unity 多人游戏选择正确的网络代码", "url": "/posts/Choosing-the-right-netcode-for-your-Unity-multiplayer-game/", "categories": "Unity, Netcode", "tags": "multiplayer game", "date": "2021-11-29 00:00:00 +0800", "snippet": "https://docs.unity3d.com/cn/2021.2/Manual/UNet.htmlhttps://blog.unity.com/technology/choosing-the-right-netcode-for-your-gamehttps://create.unity3d.com/form-netcode-report " } ]
